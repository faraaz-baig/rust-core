# RustCore MVP Development Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Runtime

1. Set up development environment
   - Install Rust nightly and required tools (QEMU, cross-compilation tools)
   - Set up a version control repository (e.g., Git)

2. Create a bare-metal Rust program
   - Implement a basic bootloader
   - Set up memory management (stack and heap allocation)
   - Implement simple console output

3. Develop hardware abstraction layer (HAL)
   - Start with a single target architecture (e.g., x86_64)
   - Implement basic CPU and memory management functions

4. Implement basic interrupt handling
   - Set up an Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)
   - Handle basic hardware interrupts

## Phase 2: Core OS Features

5. Implement a basic scheduler
   - Create a simple cooperative multitasking system
   - Implement basic task management

6. Develop a minimal device driver framework
   - Create abstractions for common device types
   - Implement drivers for essential devices (e.g., timer, keyboard)

7. Implement a basic memory allocator
   - Create a simple but efficient heap allocator
   - Implement memory protection mechanisms

## Phase 3: Networking

8. Implement a basic network stack
   - Start with a minimal Ethernet driver
   - Implement core protocols: IP, TCP, UDP
   - Create a simple API for network operations

9. Develop network utilities
   - Implement DNS resolution
   - Create a basic HTTP client

## Phase 4: Application Support

10. Create a build system
    - Develop a way to compile Rust applications into the unikernel
    - Implement a linking strategy for applications and the kernel

11. Implement standard library support
    - Port essential parts of the Rust standard library
    - Create safe abstractions for system calls

## Phase 5: Testing and Documentation

12. Develop a testing framework
    - Create unit tests for kernel components
    - Implement integration tests using QEMU

13. Write documentation
    - Create API documentation
    - Write a user guide for building applications with RustCore

## Phase 6: Example Application

14. Develop a sample edge computing application
    - Create a simple data processing or IoT-like application
    - Demonstrate the benefits of the unikernel approach

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization

15. Implement performance profiling
    - Create tools for measuring boot time, memory usage, and execution speed
    - Identify and optimize critical paths in the kernel
